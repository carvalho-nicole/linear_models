# Task based functional connectivity linear models

This project aimed to use linear models to compare the functional connectivity between five different tasks: a sentence reading task, a sentence listening task, a story listening task, a movie watching task, and a resting state task. This code pulls together the dataframes with functional connectivity values and creates one master dataframe. Then the linear model is run and the data is visualized.
